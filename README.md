# Crime Prediction Using Machine Learning - Group Assignment
## Project Overview

This was a group assignment done by myself, Priscilla Nitschke and Sharlene Gray
Where we wanted to investigate if we could use Machine Learning Algorithms and 
the Police New Zealand's dataset to predict crimes with different input variables.
Such as Police Numbers By District, Household Living costs, Unemployment rate, Police 
District, Time of Day etc.

We created this small Python StreamLit Application to show our results from the Linear 
Regression Model and Naive Bayes Classifier with different input variables.
I have also included a .pdf Notebook containing our code.
This has the Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis,
K means clustering, timelines of crimes, per district, Household Living cost data,
Naive Bayes classification, Linear Regression, 

### Contributions
My Contributions were K means clustering, some Naive Bayes classification and the Naive
Bayes Classification in the StreamLit Application.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

Clone this GitHub repository:

Install Anaconda Python and open Anaconda Navigator.

Open the Anaconda Prompt.

Change directory to the cloned repository:

cd nzpolicedataStreamlit

Use Anaconda Python, Open Anaconda Navigator.

open the Anaconda Prompt

cd into said directory "nzpolicedata"

pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlist run main.py

Open StreamLit Application

# Open application
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://192.168.86.30:8501

or something to the likes of that will be displayed.

Navigate to this in your browser.

It will take a while to load as the dataset is quite large

Follow the instructions on screen, select some variables
